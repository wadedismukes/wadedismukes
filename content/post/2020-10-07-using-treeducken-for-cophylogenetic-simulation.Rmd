## Setting up
In this post, I will give a brief exploration of the features available for cophylogenetic simulation in my new R package: `treeducken`.
First, you will need to install the package and then load it:

```{r}
# install.packages("treeducken")
library(treeducken)
```


## Set parameters and simulate!

First I need to set some parameters.
Currently, there is only a  way to simulate to a pre-specified time.
We need to set six parameters: host speciation and extinction rate, symbiont speciation and extinction rate, host expansion rate, and cospeciation rate.
These rates are set relative to the time; for example setting the speciation to 0.1 translates to 1 speciation every 10 time units. 
To assist with determining these parameters, we provide functions that calculate the expected numbers of tips under the SSA.
In this code chunk we draw some random parameters for our host and symbiont birth rates, and calculate their expected numbers of tips.
We then use these randomly drawn parameters to simulate under the cophylogenetic process.
Figure 3 shows the output of one such simulation.


```{r setting-params}
set.seed(54)
lambda_H <- rexp(n=1)
mu_H <- lambda_H / 2
lambda_C <- rexp(n=1)
time <- 1.0

lambda_S <- rexp(n=1)
mu_S <- lambda_S / 2

H_tips <- treeducken::calculate_expected_leaves_sptree(lambda = lambda_H + lambda_C,
                                                       mu = mu_H,
                                                       t = time)

S_tips <- treeducken::calculate_expected_leaves_sptree(lambda = lambda_S + lambda_C,
                                                       mu = mu_S,
                                                       t = time)
cophy_obj <- treeducken::sim_cophylo_bdp(hbr = lambda_H, hdr = mu_H,
                                         sbr = lambda_S, sdr = mu_S,
                                         cosp_rate = lambda_C, host_exp_rate = 0.0,
                                         time_to_sim = time, numbsim = 1)
plot(cophy_obj[[1]], col = "orange", lty = "dotted")
```

## Other features

Cophylogenetic objects are output as an S3 object of class `cophy` with many S3 generic functions implemented including `summary`, `plot` (see above), `c()` and `print`.
The structure of this class is largely based on the `cophylo` S3 object of PhyTools, and we modified code written for generic function definitions from the APE package. 
Here I've provided some examples of the generic functions, more are provided within the documentation.

See `print()` below:

```{r}
print(cophy_obj, details = TRUE)
summary(cophy_obj[[1]])
```

Or `summary`:

```{r}
summary(cophy_obj[[1]])
```

We can also calculate (a limited amount of) summary statistics for our treeset. There is a function to calculate some for all of the `cophy` objects in a list, or some are available separately (e.g. `parafit_test`):

```{r}
df <- treeducken::cophy_summary_stat(cophy_obj)
D <- treeducken::parafit_stat(cophy_obj[[1]]$host_tree,
                              cophy_obj[[1]]$symb_tree,
                              cophy_obj[[1]]$association_mat)
treeducken::parafit_test(cophy_obj[[1]]$host_tree,
                              cophy_obj[[1]]$symb_tree,
                              cophy_obj[[1]]$association_mat,
                         D = D,
                         reps = 99)
```
The event numbers such as "Cospeciations" and "Host_Speciations" here are only calculated if the `Event_DF` member of the `cophy` object is present. 
This will always be there if you simulate data using `sim_cophylo_bdp()`, but won't be if you use the built-in functions to setup a cophylogenetic object. I provide an example of doing that with the classic Hafner and Page gopher-louse dataset below:

```{r}
gopher_lice_map <- read.table(system.file("extdata",
                                          "gopher_lice_mapping.txt",
                                          package = "treeducken"),
                              stringsAsFactors = FALSE, header = TRUE)

gopher_lice_assoc_matrix <- convert_assoc_table_to_matrix(gopher_lice_map)
gopher_tree <- ape::read.nexus(system.file("extdata",
                                           "gophers_bd.tre",
                                           package = "treeducken"))
lice_tree <- ape::read.nexus(system.file("extdata",
                                         "lice_bd.tre",
                                         package = "treeducken"))
gopher_lice_cophylo <- convert_to_cophy(hostTree = gopher_tree,
                                          symbTree = lice_tree,
                                          assocMat = gopher_lice_assoc_matrix)
print(gopher_lice_cophylo)
cophy_summary_stat(gopher_lice_cophylo)

plot(gopher_lice_cophylo,
     fsize = 0.5,
     show_tip_label = FALSE,
     gap = 1,
     col = "purple",
     lty = "dashed")
```

## Using `treeducken` with PACo

I can use the `treeducken` output with the [`paco` package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/paco/index.html).
If there are extinct tips in the host or symbiont tree these need to be pruned off prior to being used with the `paco` package.
Pruning can be done with the `drop_extinct` function.

```{r paco-example}
library(paco)
host_tree_pruned <- drop_extinct(cophy_obj[[1]]$host_tree)
symb_tree_pruned <- drop_extinct(cophy_obj[[1]]$symb_tree)
A <- association_mat(cophy_obj[[1]])
host_dist <- cophenetic(host_tree_pruned)
symb_dist <- cophenetic(symb_tree_pruned)
links <- t(A) # paco wants associations with rows as hosts 

# we need to name rows and columns for paco
rownames(links) <- host_tree_pruned$tip.label
colnames(links) <- symb_tree_pruned$tip.label 
D <- paco::prepare_paco_data(H = host_dist, P = symb_dist, HP = links)
D <- paco::add_pcoord(D)
D <- paco::PACo(D, nperm=100, seed = 11, method="r0")
print(D$gof)
```

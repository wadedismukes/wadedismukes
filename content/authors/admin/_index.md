Wade Dismukes is a graduate candidate in the lab of [Tracy Heath](http://phyloworks.org/). He researches host-symbiont cophylogenetic methods using computers. Cophylogenetics deals with explaining congruence/incongruence between the phylogeny of two groups of ecologically related species. The most common example of this is between hosts and their symbionts (i.e. parasites or mutualists).

Wade is also a developer on the [Revbayes](https://revbayes.github.io) phylogenetic software and is the author of the phylogenetic simulation R package, [treeducken](https://github.com/rtreeducken).
